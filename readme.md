<h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
A Rothko art box. This project helped me understand the difference between content, padding, border, and margin.

<h3>Biggest Challenge</h3>
This project wasn't difficult. I finished it in one go. It just improved my awareness of how box model works.

<h3>Biggest Takeway</h3>
The box shadow property allows you to add border to specific sides of a box. Blur radius allows you to round the edges of the box. Filter allows you to blur an entire element. Overflow allows you to specify how text is viewed inside a box. For example, if I write overflow: scroll the box size doesn't change but the text can be scrolled inside.
